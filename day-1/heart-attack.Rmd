## Description

Patients who experience a heart attack tend to do better if the condition is diagnosed early. Smith (1967) describes a study that looked into using the levels of the enzyme *creatinine kinase* (`ck`) in patients' blood. The creatinine kinase level was measured in the blood of 360 patients suspected of suffering a heart attack. Whether each patient had suffered a heart attack was determined later with traditional medical care and tests.

## Packages

Load the following packages

```{r load-packages}
pkgs <- c("readr", "dplyr", "ggplot2")
vapply(pkgs, library, logical(1L), character.only = TRUE, logical.return = TRUE)
```

## Data

The data are contained in `data/heart-attack.csv`, and consist of three variables

1. `ck`, the creatinine kinase level for each patient. The original paper binned patients into groups of CK levels. Here we use the mid points of the bins,
2. `attack`, the number of patients who experienced a heart attack
3. `ok`, the number of patients who did not experience a heart attack

Load the data into R

```{r load-data}
ck <- read_csv(here("data", "heart-attack.csv"), col_types = "ddd")
ck
```

## Data wrangling

Create a variables in `ck` for:

1. `total` --- the total number of patients in each `ck` bin, and
2. `proportion` --- the proportion of the total number of patients that suffered a heart attack

```{r wrangling}
ck <- ck %>%
  mutate(total = attack + ok,
         proportion = attack / total)
```

## Task

1. Produce a plot of the proportion of patients who suffered a heart attack vs the creatinine kinase level in the patient's blood

```{r plot}

head(ck)

ck %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ck, y = proportion)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Creatinine Kinase level",
       y = "Proportion of patients with heart attack")

```

2. Fit a binomial GLM (logit link) using the `glm()` to model the proportion of patients who suffered a heart attack as a function of the creatinine kinase level in the patient's blood

    Hint: If you're not sure how to specify the response for the GLM, read the *Details* section of `?glm`. You can use either the

        * two-column matrix version or,
        * the proportion as response but specify total counts via the `weights` argument
        
```{r model}

m <- glm(proportion ~ ck, 
    weights = total,
    family = binomial(link="logit"),
    data = ck)

ck_model <- m

```

3. Produce the model summary using `summary()`

    Is the effect of `ck` on the proportion of patients with heart attacks statistically significant?

```{r model-summary}

summary(ck_model)

# Yes it is

```


4. Calculate a quick goodness of fit test for the model using the information provided on the residual deviance

```{r}

pchisq(deviance(ck_model), 
       df.residual(ck_model), 
       lower.tail = FALSE)

```


5. Plot the model diagnostics

```{r}
plot(ck_model)

performance::check_model(ck_model)

```


6. Add fitted values of the model as a line on to the plot you created earlier

```{r}

# could just save the graph from earlier and add to it but repeated here

summary(ck_model)

predicted_data <- with(ck,
                       tibble(ck = seq(1, 500, length = 100)))

# predict
pred <- predict(ck_model, 
                predicted_data,
                type = "link", 
                se.fit = TRUE)

ilink <- family(ck_model)$linkinv # g-1()

predicted_data <- 
  predicted_data %>%
  data.frame(pred) %>%
  mutate(fitted = ilink(fit),
         upper = ilink(fit + (2 * se.fit)),
         lower = ilink(fit - (2 * se.fit)))

head(predicted_data)

ck %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ck, y = proportion)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower, 
                  ymax = upper,
                  x = ck), 
              data = predicted_data,
              inherit.aes = FALSE, 
              alpha = 0.2) +
    geom_line(data = predicted_data, aes(y = fitted)) +
  labs(x = "Creatinine Kinase level",
       y = "Proportion of patients with heart attack") +
    theme_bw() 

#OR:
fitted(ck_model)
ck %>%
  mutate(fitted_1 = fitted(ck_model)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ck, 
                 y = proportion)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y = fitted_1)) +
  labs(x = "Creatinine kinase level", y = "Proportion Heart Attack") +
  theme_bw()

```


7. Looking at the model diagnostics and the plot of the fitted values versus the data, identify a problem with this model. Describe the problem in a few words.

8. Modify your model to account for the identified problem

    Hint: use ploynomials of `ck`
    
```{r}

ck_model2 <- glm(proportion ~ poly(ck, 3),
    weights = total,
    family = binomial(link="logit"),
    data = ck)

summary(ck_model2)

ck %>%
  mutate(fitted_2 = fitted(ck_model2)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ck, 
                 y = proportion)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y = fitted_2)) +
  labs(x = "Creatinine kinase level", y = "Proportion Heart Attack") +
  theme_bw()

```


9. Look at the model summary, model diagnostic plots, and perform the goodness of fit test on the residual deviance. Are there any problems with this model?

```{r}

summary(ck_model2)
plot(ck_model2)

# still not great!

```


10. Compare the two models using AIC and a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). Which model is to be preferred?

    Hint: the `anova()` function is used to do the GLRT
    
```{r}

AIC(ck_model, ck_model2)

anova(ck_model, ck_model2, test = "LRT")

```
